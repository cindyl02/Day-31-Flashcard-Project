## FlashCard App (Day 31)
### About
This project is a learning project which uses Tkinter to create a GUI for a flashcard app and Pandas library to read from a csv file containing French to English translated words. The card will flip after 3 seconds and words that are learned will be removed from the list of words to learn and saved into a separate csv file.

### How to run
1. Delete any "words_to_learn.csv" from the project to start from scratch. 
2. Add any new words you want to learn into "french_words.csv".
3. Run main.py.
